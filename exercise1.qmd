## Exercise 2.2.5

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

#### 1. How many rows are in `penguins`? How many columns?

```{r}
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins) 
```

#### 2. What does the `bill_depth_mm` variable in the `penguins` data frame describe? Read the help for [`?penguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html) to find out.

#### *Answer = a number denoting bill depth (millimeters)*

#### 3. Make a scatterplot of `bill_depth_mm` vs. `bill_length_mm`. That is, make a scatterplot with `bill_depth_mm` on the y-axis and `bill_length_mm` on the x-axis. Describe the relationship between these two variables.

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins,
 mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm , y = bill_depth_mm))+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species ))+ 
   geom_smooth() +
  labs(
     title = "Bill length and Bill depth",
    subtitle = "Relation of bill_length and bill_depth",
     x = "bill_length (mm)", y = "bill_depth (mm)",
     color = "species" ,shape = "species" )+  
  theme_light()
```

#### 4. What happens if you make a scatterplot of `species` vs. `bill_depth_mm`? What might be a better choice of geom?

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = species  , y = bill_depth_mm))+
    geom_point()
```

#### *This will be a better choice of geom*

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins,
    mapping = aes(x = species , y = bill_depth_mm))+
   geom_jitter(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
   labs(
    title = "Species and Bill depth",
    subtitle = "Bill depth bar chart according to species",
    x = "Species", y = "Bill_depth_mm " )+  
  theme_bw()    
```

#### 5. Why does the following give an error and how would you fix it?

```         
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_point()
```

#### You will get an error because mapping argument is absent and aes function is also absent

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins,
 mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm))+
  geom_point()
```

#### 6. What does the `na.rm` argument do in [`geom_point()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html)? What is the default value of the argument? Create a scatterplot where you successfully use this argument set to `TRUE`.

```{r}
 ggplot(na.rm = TRUE ,data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm , y = bill_depth_mm))+
    geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species))+
      geom_smooth()
```

#### 7. Add the following caption to the plot you made in the previous exercise:

"Data come from the palmerpenguins package." Hint: Take a look at the documentation for [`labs()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html).

```{r}
ggplot(na.rm = TRUE ,data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm , y = bill_depth_mm))+
      geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species))+
      geom_smooth() +
      labs(
 caption = "Data come from the palmerpenguins package" )
```

#### 8. Recreate the following visualization. What aesthetic should `bill_depth_mm` be mapped to? And should it be mapped at the global level or at the geom level?

![](images/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)

```{r}
 ggplot(na.rm = TRUE,
           data = penguins,
           mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm , y = body_mass_g))+
      geom_point(aes(color = bill_depth_mm))+ 
      geom_smooth() +
      labs(
        title = "Flipper length and Body mass",
        subtitle = "Relation of flipper_length_mm and body_mass_g",
        x = "flipper_length (mm)", y = "body_mass (g)",
        color = "species" ,shape = "species")+  
      theme_light()
```

#### 9. Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like. Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = island)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

#### 10. Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

ggplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = penguins,
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = penguins,
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
  )
```
